# 🝡 Use Case
If you have a large text files with a bunch of links and you to wish to open all or some of them in a browser, instead of manually clicking each one of them you can just configure and run this python script.

# ∵ Why I made it
I found an article on LinkedIn about topic wise must do leetcode questions and I wanted to go through each link and solve the ones that I haven't already but the article was huge and I didn't want to open problem link manually so I made this.

# ⚙️ Steps to use
1. Install dependencies:
    - Ensure python and pip is installed
    - Run this: `​pip3 install webbrowser`

2. Paste your text with embedded links in the links.txt file or create it
3. Run: python3 open_links.py
