# Use Case
If you have a large text files with a bunch of links and you to wish to open all or some of them in a browser, instead of manually clicking each one of them you can just configure and run this python script.

# Why I made it
I found an article on LinkedIn about topic wise must do leetcode questions and I wanted to go through each link and solve the ones that I haven't already but the article was huge and I didn't want to open problem link manually so I made this.

# Prerequisites
`​pip3 install webbrowser` run this
