nterviewer: How would you optimize the performance of the web application ?

1. Minimize HTTP requests by bundling and minifying assets (CSS, JS).

2. Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical resources.

3. Use caching techniques (browser caching, server-side caching) to reduce server load.

5. Compress and optimize images to reduce file size without losing quality.
 
6. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.

7. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets from geographically distributed servers.

8. Minimize the use of blocking JavaScript and prioritize asynchronous operations.

9. Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for improved initial page load times.

These are some strategies I'm considering to optimize the performance of a web application.
